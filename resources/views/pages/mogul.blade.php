                        <b> There are three stages involved in working with the Mogul CEO simulations</b>
                        <ol>
                            <li class="pt-2">
                                <b> The Forecasting Stage:</b> <br>
                                you enter decisions to test “what if” assumptions and then modify
                                those decisions until you enter a preferred set of decisions you think are the best.
                            </li>
                            <li class="pt-2">
                                <b> The Processing Stage:</b> <br>
                                an administrator program assesses the decisions of all competitors to
                                determine market share allocations for each company and the consequent profitability of
                                each
                                company based on its operational performance.
                            </li>

                                <b> The Results Stage:</b> <br>
                                Once your decisions have been processed, the Mogul CEO programs will
                                provide reports that show how well your company performed in competition with the
                                competing
                                companies. You respond to the results of the processing of your decisions, looking at
                                your
                                company’s reports to assess your actual versus forecasted performance. Then you will use
                                your
                                analysis in a new Forecasting Stage as you begin the next decision round.
