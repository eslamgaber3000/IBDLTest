                    IBDL Professional Course Accreditation is designed to help learners choose the best course in
                    support of their professional project management career. Professional Course Accreditation
                    identifies those courses which are aligned to the IBDL Body of Knowledge, but do not lead to, or
                    cover the syllabus of, formal IBDL professional qualification.
