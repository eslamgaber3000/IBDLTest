                            Deloitte’s latest Government & Public Services (GPS) Human Capital Trends report shows that
                            69 percent of survey respondents see redesigning jobs for their organizations as
                            important—with 32 percent reporting they’re ready to transform jobs substantially. The
                            half-life of most professional skills has shrunk to three years. In the face of resource
                            constraints, how can organizations maintain pace with this evolving landscape? Leaders who
                            use data to continuously assess their learning and development needs, approaches, and impact
                            are better able to reskill and upskill their employees to meet changing situations.

                            the need for additional information to understand the readiness of their workforce to
                            meet new demands, while 38 percent said that identifying needs and priorities is the
                            greatest barrier to workforce development.
