                            Universities Internationalization
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The increasing focus on internationalization in higher education institutions worldwide is
                            driven by its significance in sustaining higher education at a national level and its
                            contribution to a nation's development, its people, and its competitiveness in the global
                            market. Internationalization plays a crucial role in economic well-being, facilitated by the
                            liberalization of international trade, as outlined in the General Agreement on Trade in
                            Services (GATS). This has resulted in the presence of foreign universities or their branches
                            operating in host countries, the expansion of cross-border or online course offerings
                            through technological advancements, and the growth of knowledge societies that prioritize
                            the dissemination of knowledge to enhance human well-being.

                            Rating and Ranking

                        <p>
                            We have a track record of helping universities towards their rating and ranking journey. We
                            work closely with QS to ensure our clients receive the utmost value. The QS World University
                            Rankings® compare universities to one another and puts them in order. Based on how the
                            institutions perform across six indicators, QS produces rankings designed to assess
                            universities in four areas: Research, Teaching Employability, and Internationalization.
                            Rankings often include only the top 100 or top 1000 universities across the globe, meaning
                            that smaller or newer universities have a difficult time competing with Harvard and Oxford.
                            Who’s good at what? A rating assesses universities and colleges on how they perform in
                            several areas, similar to the areas considered in rankings. But rather than comparing
                            institutions against one another, they are judged on how they perform against a set
                            standard.

                            Student and Faculty Mobility
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We adopt the Erasmus+ approach, where this higher education mobility is meant to support
                            physical and blended mobility of higher education students in any study field and cycle
                            (short cycle, bachelor, master and doctoral levels). Students can either study abroad at a
                            partner higher education institution or carry out a traineeship in an enterprise, a research
                            institute, a laboratory, an organization or any other relevant workplace abroad. Students
                            can also combine a study period abroad with a traineeship, further enhancing the learning
                            outcomes and development of transversal skills. While long-term physical mobility is
                            strongly encouraged, our approach recognizes the need to offer more flexible physical
                            mobility duration to ensure the Program is accessible to students from all backgrounds,
                            circumstances and study fields. We also support higher education teaching and administrative
                            staff to participate in professional development activities abroad and staff from the world
                            of work to teach and train students or staff at higher education institutions. These
                            activities may consist of teaching and training periods (such as job shadowing, observation
                            periods, and training courses).

                            Faculty Members Recruitment
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The past year has been difficult for department heads and prospective faculty alike, between
                            ongoing delays, hiring freezes, budget cuts and the struggle to determine whether applicants
                            are qualified without the benefit of extensive on-campus evaluations. Even so, the struggles
                            and crises brought on by the pandemic also provided eye-opening lessons. Issues that had
                            been chronically overlooked became impossible to ignore, and practices that once went
                            unquestioned were met with new options and perspectives. (ASBMB Today) we have a wide reach
                            of top qualified and diversified faculty members, our recruitment specialists are very
                            particular about the qualities of the faculty we recruit on behalf of our clients. We do not
                            only recruit but also provide a proper cultural orientation that leverage the adaptation and
                            engagement of our faculty into the new community.

                            The Digitization of Higher Education
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Technology's value to organizations and individuals increasingly extends beyond productivity
                            to enhance learning, collaboration, and decision-making. Higher Education Institutions thus
                            find it increasingly necessary to develop and apply digital capabilities to survive, let
                            alone thrive. About one in three colleges and universities is a self-described early adopter
                            of technology, one in four is a late adopter, and the rest (39 per cent) are mainstream
                            adopters. Early adopters are rushing to incorporate trends like the Internet of Things,
                            personalized learning, and agility into their IT strategy. They are also deploying new
                            technologies more rapidly, putting more effort into over half of the approximately 80
                            emerging technologies. Mainstream adopters, in turn, devote more effort than those
                            identifying as late adopters. Extrapolating based on their stated plans, the early adopters
                            will move further ahead of the pack, and the late adopters will struggle further behind.

                            Summer Schools
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There are so many benefits to attending a summer school! From social, cultural, and academic
                            benefits, to life experience and confidence - the benefits of attending a good summer
                            program are difficult to list in just one article, but we're going to try. Summer Schools
                            and Summer Programs have been around for a long time. However, over the past few years,
                            there has been a move towards more university summer schools for high school students, and
                            the UK has quickly followed suit. The benefits of attending a high-quality summer program in
                            the UK and especially in Scotland are realized by parents, teachers, schools, and young
                            people worldwide. One of the best things about Scotland is its diversity. The rolling
                            countryside, bustling cities, icy mountain peaks and charming villages all combine to
                            provide an excellent destination for your cottage holiday in the UK, whether you're looking
                            for an action-packed break, a cultural adventure or a relaxing retreat.
